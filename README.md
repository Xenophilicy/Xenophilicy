## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profileüëã

Thanks for stopping by! You might know me from my [PocketMine plugins on Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/plugins/by/Xenophilicy). While they turned out very successful (many of which have over 10k downloads‚ù§Ô∏è), I regret to inform everyone that my support for those plugins will no longer be offered. Updates will not be pushed, and no new planned changes will follow through. This is due to lack of free time and interest in maintaining public projects. **Please do not inquire on Discord for plugin support, you will be ignored and blocked.** Sorry for any inconvenience and thanks for understanding.

I own a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server with lots of custom written plugins and features. Come by and check us out by [joining our Discord](https://discord.xenoservers.net) or [adding our server](https://xenoservers.net/join) to your Minecraft client! We offer many monolithic gamemodes such as Prison and SkyBlock, along with some new minigames servers with games like Skywars and more coming soon!

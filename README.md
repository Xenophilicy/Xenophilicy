I own a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server with fully custom written plugins and lots of fun features. Come and check us out by [joining our Discord](https://discord.xenoservers.net) or [adding our server](https://xenoservers.net/join) to Minecraft! We offer gamemodes like Prison & SkyBlock, along with some new minigames like Skywars, BedWars, Infection, and more coming very soon!

You might know me from my [PocketMine plugins on Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/plugins/by/Xenophilicy). While they turned out very successful (many of which have over 10k downloads‚ù§Ô∏è), I regret to inform everyone that my **support for those plugins will no longer be offered**. Updates will not be pushed, and no new planned changes will follow through. This is due to a lack of free time and interest in maintaining the public projects. Sorry for any inconvenience and thanks for understanding. **Please DO NOT inquire on Discord for plugin support, you WILL be ignored and blocked.**
